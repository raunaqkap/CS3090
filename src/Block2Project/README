What This Program Does:

This program determines the strength of a password by checking whether it meets the following requirements:

- Contains at least one uppercase letter (A–Z)
- Contains at least one of the following special characters: ! @ # $ % & ?
- Is at least 8 characters long

The program returns a message with any requirements that aren't met or confirms the password is strong if all requirements are satisfied.

How to Run:

1. Open the project in a Java IDE
2. Find the Block2Project Package
3. Find the password strength checker class
4. Run the main method
5. Enter the password when prompted in the console

Limitations:

This tool is for educational use only and should not be used to validate sensitive passwords.
This password checker only checks simple passwords using the following special characters:! @ # $ % & ?.


Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use:

This program was created for a school project. It is not intended for use in real applications.


Some ways that this tool could be misused include giving users a false sense of security, using it to steal users' passwords, or using it to purposefully create weak passwords
that circumvent the password requirements presented.

Responsible Use Guidelines
Don't use this tool as the only way of checking if a password is secure in real world applications.
Users should know that a password that passes this password checker is not guaranteed to be secure.
